Kwise:

page - Represents a set of text pattern used to group one of more paragraphs or sentences into a single logical block.
	:insequence - Paragraphs and sentences are in page order (top to bottom) (default)
	:unsequence - Paragraphs can be in any order

paragraph - Is designed to disect the document into smaller identifiable chunks to breakdown the document into smaller
	    groups of text. Each page must have at least one paragraph. 

	:oneof	- Must match one sentence. Complete if and only if exactly one sentence is matched. (default)
	:someof	- Must match one or more sentences. Complete if at least one is matched
	:anyof	- Can match as many as possible or none at all. Marked as complete by default.
	:allof	- All sentences must match. Complete when all match.

	A sentence is marked as complete when it successfully executes its collection directives.

	:begin	- Identifies the first paragraph of the page (only case directives allowed)
	:end	- Identifies the last paragraph of the page (only case directives allowed).

	Only one paragraph can have a directive of begin and end. Both begin and end can't be used on the same 
	paragraphs. The first sentence of a begin or end directive defines the start pattern if the start directive is
	not applied to a sentence. The start directive overrides the paragraph directive begin. 

sentence - Represents a line pattern(s) of identifiers used to locate a pattern of occurences that can be used to select
	   a pattern of text. A sentence block must ends in an action, except when designated as a start block, and each
	   paragraph must have at least one sentence.

	:isthere - cannot have an action, cannot have a condition, only returns (true || false)
	:start - Only one sentence can have a start directive and if not then the first sentence of the paragraph
		that defines :begin is used as the start pattern. If no begin or start directive then the first
		sentence of the first paragraph is the start pattern.
		The start pattern enables the collection of information once it is found. All patterns are ignored
		until a start pattern is found. A designated start sentence can't have a collection directive.


identifier - Represents a known pattern and is satified if all attributes and conditions are met.
		- conditions:	Describe the matched identifier structure.
				:follow - Follow previous sentence if matched (default)
				:follow-regardless - Don't depend on previous sentence (insequence only).
		- actions:	Describe how the identifier is harvested
				xxx -:collect-quote - extracts all data immediately following token between quotes
			:collect-next 	- Returns all text till next token (Needs additional info. e.g. token identifier)
			:collect-line	- Returns all text on current line after identifier
				xxx - :concat-comma	- Returns all matching as comma seperated quoted list
				xxx - :concat-tab	- Returns all matching as tab seperated quoted list
				xxx - :concat		- Returns all matching as space seperated list
				xxx - :complete	- stops rule processing and returns status for identifier.

		- criteria:	If specified provides a boolean status for the identifier

		- "identifier":	true only if quoted identifier is found between quotes
			- attributes:	Enhance identifiers by specifying specific criteria about the identifier
					:exact	- quoted identifier must match exactly
					:any	- Any location in quotes of token
					:exclude - Exclude any quoted identifie that contains

Commands:
	:casemixed	- Does not translate case of identifiers.
	:caselower	- Compares case of identifiers in lower case


Patterns:
There are two types of patterns called search and collection.

A search pattern is used to identify sequences of sentences that lead to the collection of the pattern.
Directives are not allowed on search strings. Search strings are separated into tokens ignoring whitespace
except when enclosed in single/double quotes. Strings containing leading numbers followed by letters are broken
into two tokens, one containing numbers and the other containing letters. e.g. 123abc becomes 123 abc.
To prevent this behavior surround the string in quotes.



Lines are broken down into tokens

Example:
	view-source:http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/7.10/general/dbus-glib.html

	page :insequence {
		paragraph :begin :isthere {
			:casemixed
			sentence :isthere :start {
				<!DOCTYPE>
			}
		}
		paragraph package {
			sentence package {
				DIV class= "package"
				H2 "sect2" :collect-next :complete
			}
			sentence download {
				DIV class= "itemizedlist"
				UL "compact"
				LI
				P
				A href= :collect-quote :concat
			}
			sentence dependencies {
				P class= "required"
				A title= :collect-quote :concat
			}
			sentence optional {
				P class= "optional"
				A title= :collect-quote :concat
			}
		}

		paragraph commands {
			sentence steps {
				KBD class= "command" :collect-next
			}
		}

		paragraph :end {
			sentence end :isthere {
				HTML
			}
		}
	}

          the package twice.
